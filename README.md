# SkinEffects - Additional Skin Effects mod
A BepInEx plugin for some Illusion games that adds simple effects to characters' skin that are not present in the main game. The effects include sweating, wetness under shower, bukkake etc. The effects are implemented by static textures with multiple levels, they are not animated. The effects are automatically applied during gameplay, and can be used in studio in your scenes.

Note: Level of the virgin effect during 1st time depends on the girl's parameters. Some girls might not have the effect at all.

You can support development of my plugins through my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/ManlyMarco

Thanks to HCM06 for sweat, bukkake drool and blood textures. Thanks to Keitaro for butt textures.
